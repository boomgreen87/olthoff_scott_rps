# Rock Paper Scissors in Python
### An electronic take on a classic game!
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for Mac / Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock crushes Scissors

Each player gets 3 lives. 1 life is lost for every loss. The game ends when one player is out of lives.

**_Choose your weapons wisely!_**

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/).

Enjoy!
